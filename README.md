# Password-Generator
Generate a password with prompts

## Description

I created this project to generate a random password based on the criteria that the user provided when prompted using JavaScript. This helped employees access sensitive data with increased security. Once all the criteria was met, the password will be generated in the password box.


## Installation 
N/A

## Usage

To use this, you can start by clicking on generate password and will be promted to enter the number of characters you want. If the parameters are not between 8 and 128, you will be alerted again to enter a length within the range. After that, the employee will be prompted once again whether they want to include Special Characters, Numerical Values, Lower Case Characters and Upper Case Characters. Based on the parameters provided, the password generator will generate a password.
